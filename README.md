Orchestrates serial communication to MCU device utilizing CmdMessenger style communication

# Why use this?
Let's say that you want a quick and easy control mechanism for your custom hardware on Arduino or an MCU. If you write your embedded code using CmdMessenger style response system, you can quickly create a nice functional javascript object to control your hardware.


# TODO:
1 - test!
2 - test some more!
3 - write an actual doc for this project
